# Specification: Parsing the OpenAPI/Swagger File

This document outlines the process for parsing the `bangumi.json` file, which contains the OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) definition for the Bangumi API.

## 1. Objective

The primary goal is to read the `bangumi.json` file and transform it into a structured, in-memory representation that can be easily used by the SDK generator. This process will involve validating the structure and extracting key information about API endpoints, data models (schemas), and security requirements.

## 2. Key Components to Extract

The parser will focus on extracting the following information from the JSON file:

-   **API Endpoints (`paths`):**
    -   Endpoint URL (e.g., `/v0/users/{username}/collections`)
    -   HTTP Method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`)
    -   Summary and Description
    -   Parameters (path, query, header, cookie)
    -   Request Body (content type, schema)
    -   Responses (status codes, content type, schema)
-   **Data Models (`components.schemas`):**
    -   Schema Name (e.g., `User`, `Collection`)
    -   Properties (name, type, description, constraints)
    -   Relationships between schemas (e.g., nested objects, arrays)
-   **Security Schemes (`components.securitySchemes`):**
    -   Authentication type (e.g., `apiKey`, `oauth2`)
    -   Details required for authentication (e.g., header name, token URL)

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Choose a Parsing Library:**
    -   We will use a robust JSON parsing library, such as the built-in `json` module in Python, combined with data validation using a library like `Pydantic`. `Pydantic` will allow us to define models that match the OpenAPI specification structure, providing automatic validation and type hinting.
2.  **Define Pydantic Models:**
    -   Create a set of Pydantic models that mirror the structure of an OpenAPI 3.x specification. This will include models for `OpenAPI`, `Info`, `PathItem`, `Operation`, `Schema`, etc.
3.  **Parsing Logic:**
    -   The `init` command will be responsible for triggering the parsing process after downloading the `bangumi.json` file.
    -   The parser will load the JSON file and instantiate the top-level `OpenAPI` Pydantic model.
    -   If the file is invalid or does not conform to the expected structure, the process will exit with a clear error message.
4.  **Output:**
    -   The parser will return a validated `OpenAPI` object, which will serve as the input for the SDK generation step.

## 4. Error Handling

-   The parser must handle cases where the `bangumi.json` file is missing, malformed, or does not adhere to the OpenAPI 3.x standard.
-   Error messages should be user-friendly and clearly indicate the nature and location of the problem (e.g., "Missing 'paths' in bangumi.json").
