# Specification: Python SDK Generation

This document details the plan for generating a Python SDK client from the parsed OpenAPI specification.

## 1. Objective

The goal is to create a dynamic and type-safe Python SDK that provides a user-friendly interface to the Bangumi API. The generation process will be automated, taking the parsed OpenAPI object as input and producing a set of Python files that constitute the client library.

## 2. Core Components of the Generated SDK

The generated SDK will consist of the following main parts:

-   **API Client:**
    -   A main `ApiClient` class that handles HTTP requests, authentication, and base URL configuration.
    -   It will use an underlying HTTP library like `requests` or `httpx` to manage connections.
    -   Authentication will be handled automatically based on the security schemes defined in the OpenAPI spec.
-   **API Endpoints (Services):**
    -   For each tag or group of endpoints in the OpenAPI spec (e.g., "Users", "Collections"), a corresponding service class will be generated (e.g., `UsersService`).
    -   Each method in the service class will map directly to an API operation (e.g., `get_user_collections(username: str)`).
    -   Method signatures will be strongly typed, including parameters, request bodies, and return types.
-   **Data Models (Pydantic):**
    -   For each schema in `components.schemas`, a corresponding `Pydantic` model will be generated.
    -   These models will provide data validation, serialization, and deserialization for request and response bodies.
    -   Relationships between models (e.g., nesting, enums) will be accurately represented.

## 3. Generation Process

1.  **Code Generation Tooling:**
    -   We will use a template engine like `Jinja2` to generate the Python code. This allows for clean separation between the generation logic and the code templates.
2.  **Templates:**
    -   A set of `Jinja2` templates will be created for:
        -   The main `ApiClient` class.
        -   Service classes for each API tag.
        -   Pydantic models for each schema.
        -   An `__init__.py` file to expose the public components of the SDK.
3.  **Generation Logic:**
    -   A generator script will iterate over the parsed `OpenAPI` object.
    -   It will process each path, operation, and schema, collecting the necessary data (e.g., function names, parameters, return types).
    -   This data will be passed to the `Jinja2` templates to render the final Python code.
    -   The generated files will be saved to a designated output directory (e.g., `bangumi_sdk/`).

## 4. Key Features

-   **Type Safety:** The generated SDK will include full type hinting, enabling static analysis and improved developer experience.
-   **Authentication:** The client will be pre-configured to handle the API key authentication required by the Bangumi API.
-   **Extensibility:** The generated code will be structured to allow for future manual extensions or overrides if needed.
-   **Documentation:** Docstrings will be automatically generated for all methods and models, based on the `summary` and `description` fields in the OpenAPI spec.

## 5. Output Directory Structure

The generated SDK will be placed in a directory with a structure similar to this:

```
bangumi_sdk/
├── __init__.py
├── client.py         # Main ApiClient class
├── models.py         # All Pydantic models
└── services/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── users.py      # UsersService class
    └── collections.py# CollectionsService class
```
