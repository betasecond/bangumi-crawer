# Bangumi-Crawer Project Setup

This document outlines the necessary steps to set up and initialize the `bangumi-crawer` project.

## 1. Get Access Token

Before you begin, you need to obtain an Access Token from [the bangumi website](https://next.bgm.tv/demo/access-token).

## 2. Configure Environment

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can do this by copying the `.env.template` file if it exists.
2.  Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_OWN_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token you acquired:

    ```env
    BANGUMI_SWAGGER=https://bangumi.github.io/api/dist.json
    BANGUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_OWN_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```

## 3. Initialize the SDK

To generate the necessary SDK files from the swagger definition, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bangumi-crawer init
```

This command will:

-   Fetch the `dist.json` from the `BANGUMI_SWAGGER` URL.
-   Update or create the access SDK based on the API definition.

You can reference the main project file here: [main.py](mdc:main.py)
